# hello-world
My first repository to serve as practice in creating a repository and further exploration.

My name is Britny Sarver. I have dabbled in programming and such via my educational endeavors; however, I am pursuing a full-time career in data analytics or software engineering and would like to improve and grow my skills. I also want to branch-out into the world of online sharing and competitions/challenges.
